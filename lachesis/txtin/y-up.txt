 Dear Mr De Morgan.  

This is very mathematical weather.
When one cannot exercise one's
muscles out of doors, one is
peculiarly inclined to exercise
one's brains in-doors.
Accordingly I have been
setting vigorously to work
again, with much satisfaction.

But I am sorry to
say that I am sadly obstinate
 about the Term at which
Convergence begins for the
Series (A) page 231 of Algebra,
and which we thought had 
been made clear by you
on Monday Evening . I must
persist in thinking Convergence
begins at 
and I have enclosed my
Demonstration of my view of
the case, & which seems to
me as clear as possible.    

At any rate this will
show you at once where my
blunder is; if I have
blundered, for I can hardly
think I have, so very palpable
does the proof appear to me.

The other night I had
unluckily been 10 days or
more without thinking about
anything of the kind, and
consequently the  thread of the
argument was not present to
me; or I might have
spared you & myself this
trouble now.     
I have thought with much
pleasure of my agreeable
evening on Monday,     
mathematical & educational.

Yours most truly

A. A. Lovelace

Dear Mr De Morgan

Will you send on the
enclosed to Mrs De Morgan.  It
explains the arrangements I have
made in case she comes here,
& also that Lord L & myself
have delayed our own departure
until Satdy next.  Our household
& children however are already
gone.

Now to mathematical business :
I think you have hit the right
nail on the head, altho' my
confused notion of Differentials was
 not the only piece of puzzle &
mistiness which constituted the
impediments towards my comprehension
of Xdudx+Ydudy=UXdudx+Ydudy=U .  The rectification of this however, has I
believe given me the key to the
remaining difficulties.  If you
will be kind enough to read
the enclosed observations,
you will be able to judge how
far I now take a just view
of the matter.

I find that when (a long time
ago) I studied Chapter V, I
never gave due importance to
the conclusion

 Δ.u = dudx1Δx1 + dudx2Δx2 + dudx3Δx3 + &cΔ.u = dudx1Δx1 + dudx2Δx2 +d udx3Δx3 + &c
+{(Δx)2,(Δx1Δx2),&c,&c} + {(Δx)2,(Δx1Δx2),&c,&c} 

deduced at the bottom of page 87,
as the result of pages 86, 87.  My
whole attention was given to the
subsequent theorem of page 90,
''If u be a function of t in different
ways'', which I conceived to be the only object in
view, & that the equation of
page 87 was of no consequence
in itself, but merely means to
an end.  This seems to have been
an egregious blunder, since the
whole theory of Differentials
rests on the very part which
I  neglected, from a merely subsidiary
theory.  I believe I am not wrong
in this present view of the
matter.

I cannot help here remarking
a circumstance which I ['believe' crossed out] think is
almost invariably true respecting
all my difficulties & confusions
in studying.  They are without any
 exception that I can recall , from
misapprehension of the meaning
of some symbol, or  some phrase
or definition; & on no occasion
from either any error in my
reasoning, or any difficulty in
carrying on chains of deductions
correctly, however complicated or
profound or lengthy.  I therefore
have lately begun to ask myself,
whenever I am stopped, whether
I clearly understand what the
subjects of the reasoning are; &
to go carefully over every verbal
& symbolic representative of a
thing or an idea, with the
question respecting each, ''now what
does it mean, & how was it got?
Am I sure of this, in each instance
involved in the subject?''  This
may save me much future trouble.

I will send you my remarks tomorrow,
as I want to look
over them once more
first; & today I
have had enough of
these subjects.

 Yours very truly

 A.A.L

Dear Mr De Morgan.  

Had I
waited a day or two longer,
I need not have troubled
you with my letter of Weddy,
& I can only reproach
myself now with having been
a little too hasty\, in my
examination of the Theorem in
pages 68, 69, and having
sent you an enquiry which
certainly indicates some
negligence.  I fear this letter
 may not be in time to
stop one from you. [something crossed out]
However I will try to
send it by an opportunity this
afternoon.
But, to show you that I
now understand the matter
completely :

In the first place the question
of the Denominator, or the
Numerator, being all of the
same sign, in such [something crossed out] collection of
expressions as
a−bm−na−bm−n, c−ap−mc−ap−m, d−cr−pd−cr−p, e−dq−re−dq−r &c
has nothing whatever to do
with the letters effacing each
other when the above are
 put into the form,
(a−b)+(c−a)+(d−c)+(e−d)(m−n)+(p−m)+(r−p)+(q−r)(a−b)+(c−a)+(d−c)+(e−d)(m−n)+(p−m)+(r−p)+(q−r) &c;
whether (a−b)(a−b), &c be positive
or negative, or some one &
some the other, still
a−b+c−a+d−c+e−dm−n+p−m+r−p+q−ra−b+c−a+d−c+e−dm−n+p−m+r−p+q−r &c
must =e−bq−n=e−bq−n 

In the second place, the
Denominator must be all of
the same sign, in order
to fulfil the conditions of
the Lemma in page 48;
& this is the reason why
the condition is made respectively
ψ xψ x always increasing or
always decreasing.
For φ xφ x, it matters not
whether it alternately increases
& decreases (provided always
that it be continuous).

I believe I now
have the whole quite clear;
& I shall be more careful
in future.
I enclose a paper upon
pages 70, 71, 72, 73.
It is merely the general
argument, put into my own
order & from; & I send
it in order to know if
you think I understand as
much about the matter as
 I am intended to do.
You know I always have
so many metaphysical
enquiries & speculations which
intrude themselves, that I
never am really satisfied
that I understand anything;
because, understand it as
well as I may, my
comprehension can only be
an infinitesimal fraction of
all I want to understand
about the many connexions
& relations which occur to
me, how the matter in
question was first thought of
 or arrived at, &c, &c.
I am particularly curious
about this wonderful Theorem.
However I try to keep
my metaphysical head in
order, & to remember Locke's
two axioms.
You should receive this about
6 o'clock this evening, if not
before.  I fear you will
have written to me today
however.  Believe me

 Yours most truly

 A. A. Lovelace

 Dear Mr De Morgan.  I have rather a large batch now for you altogether. I am in the middle of the article on Negative & Impossible Quantities; & I have a question to put on 
(a+kb)
m+nk = εA
cosB+k
εA .sinB
(a+bk)m+nk=εAcos⁡B+k
εA.sinB &c
 I have tried a little to demonstrate this Formula; but before I proceed further in spending more time upon it, I think I may as well ask if it is intended to be demonstrable by the Student.  For you know I sometimes try to do more than anyone means me to attempt. I have as yet only got thus far [something crossed] with the above formula : If in 

(a+bk)
m+nk (a+bk) m+nk,
r is given = a2 + b2
√ = a2 +b2, 
tanθ = ba

tan⁡θ=ba; then 
sinθ=b
sin⁡θ=b 
  
cosθ=a
cos⁡θ=a  and 
(a+bk)
m+nk
=(cosθ+k.sinθ)
m+nk = (a+bk) m+nk = (cos⁡θ+k.sinθ) m+nk =(εkθ)
m+nk = εk(mθ)× {εk(nθ)}
k =(εkθ) m+nk = εk (mθ) × {εk(nθ)} k 
or =(cos.mθ+k.sin.mθ)×(cos.nθ+k.sin.mθ)
k =(cos.mθ+k.sin.mθ)×(cos.nθ+k.sin.mθ)k, 

and I dare say that from some of these transformations, the Second Side of the given equation, with the determination of AA and BB, may be deduced.  But it appears to me 'it must be' a very complicated process; & therefore I should like to know before I undertook it, that I was not wasting time doing so.
 2dly : I am plagued over page 135 of the Calculus. It is not that there is any one thing in it which I do not clearly see.  But it is the depth of the whole argument which I cannot manage to discover. I should say that whole argument from ''We now know c'' page 134, to ''We can therefore take a function,''
which, for a particular value of x.
It seems to me all to be much ado about nothing; and I do not see what is arrived at by means of it.  A very complicated process appears to be used in the 1st Paragraph of page 135, to prove that when hh is small then the Increment in φx is very nearly represented by φa+h which was already shown in page 134.  And then suddenly in the Second Paragraph the Formula 
φa+φ
a (x−a) + φa+φ′a(x−a)+ 
φa(x−a)2

is introduced, & I do not understand quoi bon the closing conclusion drawn from it.

3dly : I am not sure that I agree to what you say in preference (for ascertaining Maxima & Minima) of the direct ascertainment of \ the value of φφ\) x\), over the ordinary method.  Because it seems to me in many cases impossible after you have determined 
0 or α values of φx, to determine further that the sign does change at them & how it changes, unless by means of the ordinary rule.  I have written out and enclose an example from Peacock, in which unless I had used the ordinary rule, after I had determined values for φx, I should have been at my wits' end how to bring out the conclusion.

4thly : I send you a little Maxima & Minima Theorem of my own, which occurred to me by accident; It is for φx = x2 − mx φx=x 2−mx.  

After proving it by the Differential Calculus, I have given a direct proof of another sort.  I merely wrote this, because it occurred to me; but it gave me a great deal of trouble, & I think was rather a work of supererogation; but I believe it is quite correct.  You will find enclosed in the same sheet the demonstration of ''What is the number whose excess above it's Square Root is the least possible?'' (see page 133 of the Calculus); and on the reverse side of this latter [something crossed out] is the ''verification round the 4 Right Angles'' for the continual increase together of x and it's [sic] tangent.  But here I have something further to add.  In this Chapter VIII, we hear of Differential Co-efficient which become = 0, or =α.  In this very instance, 
1 + tan
2 x 1 + tan
2x is alternately = 1, and =α. Now according to my previous ideas, the terms Differential Co-efficient was only applied to some finite quantity; and referring to pages 47, 48, where one acquired one's first ideas of a Differential Co-efficient, I think it is there clearly explained that the term is only used with reference to a finite limit.  But in this Chapter VIII, there seems to be a considerable extension of meaning on the subject.
 5thly .  In page 132, it is very clearly deduced that the Ratio of a Logarithm to it's number is increasing as long as x is <ε, and afterwards decreases.
The proof is most obvious.  But, unluckily, the conclusion seems to me to be contrary to the fact; at least the first half of the conclusion, not the latter half.
On this principle : from the very nature of a Logarithm, it is obvious that (\) x\) being >ε, for equal increments to the log,x, there will be larger & larger Increments to x.  The one being in arithmetical, the other in geometrical progression. Therefore clearly the Ratio of the Logarithm to the number, is a diminishing one.  But then the same thing seems to me to apply when x<\varepsilon\).  
Surely there is then just the same arithmetical & geometrical progression for equal Increments of the Logarithms.  I suppose there is some link that I have over-looked. I send you two Integrations worked out.  They are from Peacock.  I in vain spent hours over the one marked 2, of which I could make nothing by any method that I devised; until in despair, I looked thro' your Chapter XIII to see if I could there find any hints; & accordingly at page 277, I found a general formula which included this case.  But I do not believe I should ever have hit upon it by myself. The Integral marked 1, might of course be proved also in the same way; tho' the method is sufficient in this instance.
I have written out no more papers on Forces.  In fact there is only one more that is left for me, viz: 
f = v
dv
ds
f = vdvds.  

And for this I seeno occasion; for I am sure that I must thoro'ly understand it, after all I have written. I quite see your remarks on my having treated Acceleration of Velocity as being identical with Force; whereas, (as I now understand it), it is simply the measure of Force, & our only way of getting at expressions for this latter.  On the subject of 
v2 = 2∫fds+C
v2 = 2
∫fds+C; 
I have considered it a greatdeal; and any direct demonstration of it, after the manner of my other papers, seems to me to be quite impracticable.  Neither 
∫v.dv
∫v.dv, nor 
∫f.ds
∫f.ds  now appear to me to have any actual proto-types in the real motion.  Here then suggests itself to me the question : ''then are there certain truths & conclusions which can be arrived at by pure analysis, & in no other way?''  And also, how far abstract analytical expressions must express & mean something real, or not.  In short, it has suggested to me a good deal of enquiry, which I am desirous of being put in the way of satisfying. By the bye, I fear that one little paper of mine dropped out of the last packet.  It was a little pencil memorandum on 
∫f.ds
∫f.ds; 
& there were remarks upon it, (if you remember) in my accompanying letter.  It bears upon the above question. I could write it out again, if it has been lost.
 
Is not this a budget indeed?
Yours most truly
A. A. Lovelace
